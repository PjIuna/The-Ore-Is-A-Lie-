The Ore Is A Lie!

Not everything that glitters is loot.

The Ore Is A Lie! is a Minecraft mod created with MCreator that adds deceptive ores to the game. Fake ores spawn naturally alongside real ones in caves, but mining them is a gamble — they might explode, spawn mobs, curse the player, drop fake loot, or even give an advancement for surviving the lie.

🌟 Features

Fake versions of vanilla ores (starting with Iron, Gold, and Diamond)

• Randomized outcomes when mined:

• Explosions

• Mob spawns

• Fake loot drops

• Special advancement triggers

• Naturally generated in caves

Perfect for survival, hardcore, and modpack fun

🎮 Installation

1. Make sure you have the correct Minecraft version installed.

2. Install Quilt or Fabric.

3. Place the mod .jar into your mods folder.

4. Launch Minecraft and enjoy the chaos!

📦 How It Works

• Fake ores are custom blocks that drop items and trigger effects via MCreator procedures.

• Each ore break rolls a single random outcome, ensuring one event per block.

• Random outcomes include explosions, mob spawns, cursed drops, or player advancements.

• Blocks generate naturally underground in the same heights as the corresponding vanilla ores.
